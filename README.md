# Vale CLI Python Wrapper

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is an open-source, command-line tool for validating
content based on editorial style rules. This package acts as a basic wrapper to
pass text to Vale and return styles rules that you can use in your Python
projects.

## Installation

Add `vale_cli` package as a dependency in your `requirements.txt` file:

```shell
vale-cli
```
